# adding amd support + making a full offline VMDK

actually add this in a table for each way

table will include

amd support

offline support

prereqs

oses

hypervisor compatibility

and we can add a section in each for adding amd support

and offline 

or we could do a page but the order would be messed up  
UNLESS if we add 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want AMD support, follow the steps here now, and then return to the guide
{% endhint %}

would also work, and we could link to a common page if its common per os

or we could copy and paste the same thing for each



oh yea and amd support is macos only because kextcache, yay
